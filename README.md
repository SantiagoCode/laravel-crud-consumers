# Laravel CRUD API Consumers âœ¨

This project is a collection of three frontend applications, each developed with a different framework: `React`, `Angular`, and `Vue`. The primary goal is to investigate and understand the differences among these popular frameworks.

Each frontend application is fully integrated with an external API, provided by [`laravel-crud-api`](https://www.github.com/SantiagoCode/laravel-crud-api).

## Applications

The three applications are designed to seamlessly integrate with the API, handling all functionalities of the developed CRUD.

## External API

All three applications consume the [`laravel-crud-api`](https://www.github.com/SantiagoCode/laravel-crud-api). Additional details about this API can be provided here.
